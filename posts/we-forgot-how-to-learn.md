Often times, as adults, we learn purely for the sake of reaching something. Whether it's getting yourself out there and looking for new satisfying things to enjoy. Or perhaps you really need a better financial situation therefore you decide to pick up new skills. Or sometimes it's even to please someone, who cannot stop bothering you that you must learn something, either they specify it or not. All of these and more are simply goal-orientated, but do you truly wish to learn those things? Well that's for you to figure it out.

# Adults learning is overthought in the wrong directions

At times we get a trigger along the way - something you noticed, read or heard about the skill that caught your interest and because of it, you initiated in learning more efficiently than ever. Now if that never happend, it's either you haven't learned the topic or skill enough, or you're simply not exploring the correct sources to learn from - because there's always something!

# Random motivation to get back to learning

More often than not, when trying to learn a specific skill, we lack engagement in it and our thoughts are not there, not in the moment. We could of course 'man-handle' our thinking, force it to stay on the thing we are learning. However you won't actually force yourself to learn, at best you would just force yourself to memorise everything for your "/temp" memory. Which leads to putting yourself in a position where sooner or later you will have to reaproach the topic and try to learn again.

# Being defensive about allowing myself to learn
